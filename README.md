Day 1: Review PHP OOP concepts

Take the first day to review PHP OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes. Make sure you have a good understanding of these concepts before moving on to design patterns.

Day 2: Study the Singleton pattern

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 3: Study the Factory pattern

The Factory pattern is another creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 4: Study the Adapter pattern

The Adapter pattern is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 5: Study the Decorator pattern

The Decorator pattern is another structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 6: Study the Observer pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 7: Study the Strategy pattern

The Strategy pattern is another behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 8: Study the Template Method pattern

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 9: Study the Command pattern

The Command pattern is another behavioral pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. Study how it is used in Symfony and try implementing it yourself in a PHP project.

Day 10: Review and practice

Take the last day to review everything you've learned and practice implementing the design patterns in PHP projects. You could also try combining different patterns to see how they work together. Finally, don't forget to document your code and keep practicing to reinforce your understanding of PHP OOP concepts and design patterns.
